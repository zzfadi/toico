# About Universal Image Converter

## What is this tool?

Universal Image Converter is a free, web-based tool that transforms your images into ICO and SVG formats right in your browser. With three powerful processing modes, it serves everyone from individual developers to teams working on professional applications. The converter handles six major image formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP, and SVG.

## Three Processing Modes

**ðŸŽ¯ Single File Mode**: Perfect for quick conversions with real-time preview. Upload one image and get instant feedback with interactive size selection for ICO or scalable SVG output.

**ðŸ”¥ Batch Processing Mode**: Ideal for bulk operations. Upload multiple images simultaneously, track individual file progress, and download everything in a convenient ZIP package.

**ðŸŽ¨ Export Presets Mode**: Professional icon packages for specific platforms. Choose from iOS, Android, Web, or Windows Desktop presets, and get complete platform-ready icon sets with proper naming conventions and folder structures.

## How it works

The tool adapts to your workflow. In single file mode, drag and drop your image for instant preview and conversion. In batch mode, select multiple files and let the parallel processing handle the heavy lifting. For export presets, simply choose your target platform and upload your imageâ€”the tool automatically generates all required sizes and formats.

## Complete Privacy & Security

**Your images never leave your device.** Everything happens locally in your browser using modern web technologies:

- **No server uploads**: Your files are processed entirely on your computer using HTML5 Canvas API
- **No data collection**: We don't store, analyze, or have access to your images
- **No internet required**: Once the page loads, you can convert images offline
- **Instant processing**: No waiting for server responses or file transfers
- **No account needed**: Use the tool completely anonymously

This isn't just a privacy promiseâ€”it's technically impossible for us to access your images because they never leave your browser.

## What makes it special

**Three Processing Modes**: Choose the workflow that fits your needsâ€”single file for quick tasks, batch processing for bulk operations, or export presets for professional platform-specific packages.

**Dual Output Formats**: Generate both ICO files for traditional icon needs and SVG files for modern scalable graphics.

**Smart format handling**: Each image type gets optimized processing. SVG files are rasterized at each icon size for perfect quality, while photos get intelligent scaling with transparency detection.

**Professional export presets**: Platform-specific packages with proper naming conventions, folder structures, and size sets optimized for iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop applications.

**Batch processing**: Upload multiple files simultaneously with parallel processing, individual progress tracking, and organized ZIP downloads.

**Real-time feedback**: Progress tracking, format detection, dimension display, and helpful tips guide you to the best results without technical knowledge.

**Modern & fast**: Built with the latest web technologies including Web Workers for smooth performance on all modern browsers.

## Technical transparency

This tool uses standard web technologies available in all modern browsers:
- **File API** for reading your selected images and handling batch uploads
- **Canvas API** for image processing, resizing, and format conversion
- **Web Workers** for background processing and parallel batch operations
- **Blob API** for creating downloadable ICO and SVG files
- **ZIP.js** for client-side ZIP package generation
- **No external services** or third-party image processing APIs

The source code follows defensive programming practices with timeout protection to handle even corrupted or unusual image files gracefully. All processing modes maintain the same privacy-first architecture.

## Who is this for?

- **Web developers** creating favicons and web app icons
- **Mobile app developers** needing platform-specific icon packages for iOS and Android
- **Desktop application developers** requiring Windows and cross-platform icons
- **Design teams** working on multi-platform applications with consistent icon sets
- **Freelancers and agencies** delivering professional icon packages to clients
- **Anyone** who values privacy and wants a reliable, free image converter with professional features

## Limitations (we're honest about them)

- Maximum file sizes: 50MB for photos, 100MB for SVG files
- Requires a modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- For animated GIFs, only the first frame is used for conversion
- Very small source images (under 64Ã—64) may not produce optimal results
- Batch processing is limited by browser memory (typically 50-100 files depending on image sizes)
- Export presets generate platform-specific sizes but may require manual customization for unique requirements
