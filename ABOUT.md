# About Universal Image to ICO Converter

## What is this tool?

Universal Image to ICO Converter is a free, web-based tool that transforms your images into ICO (icon) files right in your browser. Whether you need a favicon for your website, an application icon, or custom desktop icons, our converter handles six major image formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, BMP, and SVG.

## How it works

Simply drag and drop your image onto our upload area, and the tool automatically detects your file format and creates a multi-size ICO file containing six standard icon sizes (16×16, 32×32, 48×48, 64×64, 128×128, and 256×256 pixels). You can choose which sizes to include and download your ICO file instantly.

## Complete Privacy & Security

**Your images never leave your device.** Everything happens locally in your browser using modern web technologies:

- **No server uploads**: Your files are processed entirely on your computer using HTML5 Canvas API
- **No data collection**: We don't store, analyze, or have access to your images
- **No internet required**: Once the page loads, you can convert images offline
- **Instant processing**: No waiting for server responses or file transfers
- **No account needed**: Use the tool completely anonymously

This isn't just a privacy promise—it's technically impossible for us to access your images because they never leave your browser.

## What makes it special

**Smart format handling**: Each image type gets optimized processing. SVG files are rasterized at each icon size for perfect quality, while photos get intelligent scaling with transparency detection.

**Professional quality**: High-quality resampling algorithms ensure your icons look crisp at every size, with automatic white backgrounds added to formats that don't support transparency.

**User-friendly**: Real-time format detection, dimension display, and helpful tips guide you to the best results without technical knowledge.

**Modern & fast**: Built with the latest web technologies for smooth performance on all modern browsers.

## Technical transparency

This tool uses standard web technologies available in all modern browsers:
- **File API** for reading your selected images
- **Canvas API** for image processing and resizing
- **Blob API** for creating downloadable ICO files
- **No external services** or third-party image processing APIs

The source code follows defensive programming practices with timeout protection to handle even corrupted or unusual image files gracefully.

## Who is this for?

- **Web developers** creating favicons for websites
- **App developers** needing Windows application icons
- **Designers** converting artwork to ICO format for clients
- **Anyone** who values privacy and wants a reliable, free icon converter

## Limitations (we're honest about them)

- Maximum file sizes: 50MB for photos, 100MB for SVG files
- Requires a modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- For animated GIFs, only the first frame is used for the icon
- Very small source images (under 64×64) may not produce optimal results

## Our commitment

This tool will always remain free, privacy-respecting, and client-side only. We believe in transparent web tools that put user privacy first without compromising functionality.
