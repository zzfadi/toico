- **Updated**: ~140+ tests across 10 files
- **New Tests Added**: 55+ tests specifically for new features

## Key Testing Scenarios

### Batch Processing
1. **Happy Path**: Upload multiple files → Process → Download ZIP
2. **Mixed Files**: Valid + invalid files → Separate error handling
3. **Large Batches**: Performance and memory management
4. **User Interactions**: Drag/drop, remove files, clear queue
5. **Privacy**: Local processing verification

### Export Presets
1. **Platform Coverage**: iOS, Android, Web, Desktop presets
2. **Export Flow**: Select preset → Upload image → Export → Download ZIP
3. **Customization**: Different folder structures and naming conventions
4. **Quality Validation**: Size recommendations and warnings
5. **Format Support**: ICO vs PNG based on preset requirements

### Mode Switching
1. **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between all three modes
2. **State Management**: Preserve selections and data across switches
3. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, desktop compatibility
5. **Performance**: No memory leaks during rapid switching

### Integration
1. **Cross-Mode Privacy**: All modes process locally
2. **Consistent UX**: Similar error handling and feedback patterns
3. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
4. **Format Consistency**: Shared format preferences where applicable
5. **Accessibility**: Uniform accessibility standards across features

## Quality Assurance Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Test Reliability
- **Page Object Pattern**: New helper classes reduce test fragility
- **Robust Selectors**: Multiple fallback selector strategies
